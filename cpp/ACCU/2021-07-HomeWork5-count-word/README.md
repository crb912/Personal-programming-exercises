Our lazy student wants a program that counts the number of occurrences of the word ‘the’ in a plain ascii text file. Can you oblige? Your submission can be too perfect, too obscure or, if you are still in the foothills of programming, just the best you can do.

Have fun and be careful of the traps in the problem.
