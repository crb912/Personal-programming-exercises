2.Program Example

The code examples of the project are directly from from the handout -- *Combining assembly code with C code*. My codes can be directly compiled with Cmake tool successfully.

Build with cmake:

    cd "Personal-programming-exercises/Asssembly/Combining Assembly Code with C Programs/Example"
    mkdir build ; cd build
    cmake .. && make
    ./example
